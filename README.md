# Forkify
A basic and pure vanillaJs project where I have created a static webpage to display a list of recipes a particular recipe that you want to see in detail using an API. A user can also bookmark the recipe and and add new recipes which will update the list of recipes.
FEATURES:
Pagination.
Creating a recipe.
Adding the ingredients to a current recipe.
Bookmark a recipe.
View all the recipes that are bookmarked
Search a particular recipe.

All the features are developed using vanillaJs. This was just a practice project to hone my Javascript skills.
